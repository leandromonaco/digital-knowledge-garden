## Stress

Please answer these questions and send your responses back to me before the end of the day tomorrow. Feel free to provide more context in any of your answers. And please be honest — the goal here is for me to find out how you’re really doing, not to punish anyone for feeling unproductive or overwhelmed. Everything you say will be kept confidential.
