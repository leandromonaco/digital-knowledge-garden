Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a 
  passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they 
  interact regularly.

Three characteristics are crucial:
- Domain
- Community
- Practice

**The domain**. A community of practice is not 
  merely a club of friends or a network of connections between people. It 
  has an identity defined by a shared domain of interest. Membership 
  therefore implies a commitment to the domain, and therefore a shared 
  competence that distinguishes members from other people. (You could 
  belong to the same network as someone and never know it.) The domain is 
  not necessarily something recognized as “expertise” outside the 
  community. A youth gang may have developed all sorts of ways of dealing 
  with their domain: surviving on the street and maintaining some kind of 
  identity they can live with. They value their collective competence and 
  learn from each other, even though few people outside the group may 
  value or even recognize their expertise.	
  
  **The community.** In pursuing their interest in 
  their domain, members engage in joint activities and discussions, help 
  each other, and share information. They build relationships that enable 
  them to learn from each other; they care about their standing with each 
  other. A website in itself is not a community of practice. Having the 
  same job or the same title does not make for a community of practice 
  unless members interact and learn together. The claims processors in a 
  large insurance company or students in American high schools may have 
  much in common, yet unless they interact and learn together, they do not
   form a community of practice. But members of a community of practice do
   not necessarily work together on a daily basis. The Impressionists, for
   instance, used to meet in cafes and studios to discuss the style of 
  painting they were inventing together. These interactions were essential
   to making them a community of practice even though they often painted 
  alone.
  
  **The practice.** A community of practice is not 
  merely a community of interest–people who like certain kinds of movies, 
  for instance. Members of a community of practice are practitioners. They
   develop a shared repertoire of resources: experiences, stories, tools, 
  ways of addressing recurring problems—in short a shared practice. This 
  takes time and sustained interaction. A good conversation with a 
  stranger on an airplane may give you all sorts of interesting insights, 
  but it does not in itself make for a community of practice. The 
  development of a shared practice may be more or less self-conscious. The
   “windshield wipers” engineers at an auto manufacturer make a concerted 
  effort to collect and document the tricks and lessons they have learned 
  into a knowledge base. By contrast, nurses who meet regularly for lunch 
  in a hospital cafeteria may not realize that their lunch discussions are
   one of their main sources of knowledge about how to care for patients. 
  Still, in the course of all these conversations, they have developed a 
  set of stories and cases that have become a shared repertoire for their 
  practice.		
  
  It is the combination of these three elements that constitutes
   a community of practice. And it is by developing these three elements 
  in parallel that one cultivates such a community.
