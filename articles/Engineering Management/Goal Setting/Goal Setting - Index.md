# OKRs
## Definition
OKR stands for [[Objectives]] and Key Results. OKRs help break up big, audacious missions into actionable goals and milestones.
* **Objectives (The “What”):** An objective is what you want to do. It describes our mission-supporting goal.
* **Key Results (The “How”):** Objectives must be paired with a roadmap that will help you know whether or not you’re on the path to meeting your goals.
